/*

It's a big leap from making sound we way we did before to something that sounds like a "real" synth
You can only ever do one thing at a time on any computer and you can only do it at one speed.
Teensy3.2 can do a simple opperation 96 million times a seconds. Things take a lot of little operations to do but still it's fast
but what if you want a light blinking at something faster than 1 millisecond but slower than 96MHz?

You can interip the loop after a set amount of micro or even nano seconds have passed. We can kind of thinking this like multitasking
the loop is still looping but ever X nano seconds it stops what it's doing and does the things that are in the interval
