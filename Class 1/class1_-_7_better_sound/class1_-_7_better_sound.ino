/*

  It's a big leap from making sound we way we did before to something that sounds like a "real" synth
  You can only ever do one thing at a time on any computer and you can only do it at one speed.
  The Teensy 3.2 can do a simple operation 96 million times a seconds. Things take a lot of little operations to do but still it's fast
  but what if you want a light blinking at something faster than 1 millisecond but slower than 96MHz?

  You can interrupt the loop after a set amount of micro or even nano seconds have passed. We can kind of thinking this like multitasking
  the loop is still looping but ever X nano seconds it stops what it's doing and does the things that are in the interval
